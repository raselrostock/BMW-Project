                                                        You will receive confirmation of receipt together with details of the expected exhibition fees (in case of acceptance as exhibitor) once the documents have arrived. 

                                                        Please note that submitting an application does not entitle you to participate. Decisions regarding which exhibitors will participate in BMW Motorrad Days will most likely be made by April 2018. As soon as the selection of exhibitors has been agreed, you will receive notification of acceptance or rejection. Upon receipt of a positive response, you will receive comprehensive exhibitor guidelines together with details of the invoice amount due for tent rental, which must be settled on time. If the invoice amount is not transferred on time, the right to an exhibitor tent lapses and the available space will be awarded to another party. 

                                                        Applicants who have been rejected can ask to be placed on a waiting list. In the event that an exhibitor decides not to participate at short notice, an alternative applicant on the waiting list will be given the opportunity to exhibit at BMW Motorrad Days instead.
